Besides Kim Kardashian’s actual pregnancy, most people appear to look for</p><ul><li>“second baby”</li><li>“another baby”</li><li>“second pregnancy”</li></ul><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/flr-search-stats.png" alt="second baby"/></p><p>No one seems to be interested in actually having a second kid or another offspring. Everyone is only looking for topics revolving around bearing a child. But (spoiler alert) also the second child will grow up, run around, invite strange friends, and ask for tuition fees. I don’t know why people only plan for the first few months…</p><p>My personal plans do not involve another sweet little bundle lying around and asking for boobie time. Instead I look forward to talks with my kids, a fair dose of education, and a lifetime with a whole clan including a lot of grandchildren. From a statistical point of view you are more likely to have large number of grandchildren when you already have a significant number of kids. This will especially come in handy when finally sitting in a retrirement home surrounded by mostly grumpy people being jealous of your visitors. This is the only reason Christoph and I undertake all the stress that comes along with having children.</p><h2 id="is-the-second-pregnancydelivery-easier">Is the second pregnancy/delivery easier?</h2><p>As the person with the uterus I think I have at least 51 percent power of decision over the question: “how many kids do we want?”. Sure I do think about my body and therefore it is nice to learn that for most oft the woman the second delivery is much easier than the first one. Especially thinking about the fact that I needed psychotherapy to get Florentin’s birth out of my system.</p><iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/wFg8lggCCueWc" width="480" height="249" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/pregnant-pregnancy-friends-wFg8lggCCueWc">via GIPHY</a></p><p>But it unsettled me to learn from at least 3 people personally known to me that they suffered from nausea so much more in their second pregnancy than in the first one. Imagine taking care of kid number one while you hang over the toilet seat vomiting… How did the woman in the past million years manage this situation while their men haunted the mammoths? I. have. no. idea.</p><h2 id="having-a-bunch-of-kids-in-germany">Having a bunch of kids in Germany</h2><p>When a young couple is getting married, we wish them as many kids needed to form a soccer team (10 outfield players and a goal keeper). Almost no one really has eleven kids, but best wishes for reproductiveness are rather common I guess.</p><p>But when when confronted with the hard realities of everyday life and the daily struggle for existence - you get a lot of strange looks when you walk the streets with more than three kids. People even tend to describe you as anti-social, which is complete nonsense considering that Germany has a retirement system that is based on an apportionment precedure.</p><p>Being a mother and while also having a career is nearly impossible because of the family policies and the ultra traditional views of employers. We live in a patriarchic society. I as a woman experience this every day. With just one child you may go “back to normal” (which means being as powerful as your single/non-parent colleagues) in a matter of few years. But with more than one kid you are more of a risk for every employer. Just imagine that one of your children is sick and you are forced to stop your work to bring her to the doctor…</p><p>The magic word in German is “Vereinbarkeit” which describes the balance between family and work. To me Vereinbarkeit does non existent in the moment. Although Christoph and I never planned it that way we now live inside that rather traditional role model with the father bringing home all the money and the mother changing the diapers. Yes, that is what parenting is like in Germany.</p><p>As a modern couple we agreed to take chances when they come out way, so Christoph accepted a very good job offer. But it is understood that this decision might not be forever. When we are done with the baby-making-thing I will maybe start to work full-time again and he will stay at home to prepare lunch and help with the homework.</p><h2 id="you-never-know-if-you-took-the-right-decision">You never know if you took the right decision</h2><p>Maybe we will have four more kids, maybe Florentin will stay our only child. Maybe we will both have fantastic careers, maybe we will live forever in that traditional family constellation and I will die as a sick and heartbroken housewife.</p><p>But I feel that the best thing at the moment is to talk to each other about our dreams and wishes for the future and how we can manage to reach them. Without any plans or fixed schedule it turns out that we sit together at least once a week and discuss everything from education to problems with the question about the second baby. Stay tuned for the next news from our family!</p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/10/03/the-great-reunion/">The great reunion</a></h1><span class="post-date">03 Oct 2015 &ndash;</span><p>25 years ago the two parts of Germany became one again. And as every year on the 3rd of October, the day of the German reunification, we see the reruns of the events and the fall of the Berlin Wall on TV.</p><p>Since each of us was born on a different side of the wall we somehow had a out own special celebration of the events that took place 25 years ago today by getting married in the anniversary year.</p><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/reunion.jpg" alt="Family Life Rocks"/></p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/09/25/second-birthday/">Second birthday - a band aid and a gorilla</a></h1><span class="post-date">25 Sep 2015 &ndash; 3 minutes to read</span><p>Last month our son turned two, but the party felt like a premiere anyway, since we hardly celebrated his 1st birthday. Yes, he recieved some gifts, but no big party was held. We felt that he was still too young for the big family-meetup not least because he was quite afraid of unknown sounds and noises at the time. And when people meet, there are a lot of noises.</p><p>This year we invited the grandparents, aunts and uncles and two other little kids the same age. The biggest surprise was the Punch-and-Judy show my mother planned for the kids. We, the grown ups, enjoyed the play. But the kids didn’t really get it. To be honest: that was the biggest fun!</p><p>We also had a lot of cake, candles, and food. We had luck with the good wheather so that most of the guest could be seated in the garden.</p><h2 id="second-birthday-gifts-for-little-boys">Second birthday gifts for little boys</h2><p>Florentin got a lot of great stuff. Let me tell you about some of the best ones. Spoiler: None of them <a href="/parenting/2015/08/18/brass-band-music/">contained a battery compartement</a>.</p><p>The biggest gift is the big <strong>digger</strong>. And with “big” I mean big enough to sit on it. With two levers you can dig a handful of sand or little stones. What can I say: Florentin went nuts! My sister, she was the giving person, enjoyed the exitement of the little boy. Since the packaging contained the digger in dismantled parts he could hardly wait until the digger was completely put toghether. The next few days he wanted to spent every second in the garden to dig some sand and dry grass around.</p><p>After a couple of days he moved the digger too close to the concrete steps at the end of the garden and they both, Florentin and the digger, fell down over the edge. Our son was quite proud of his big bump and showed the band aid to everyone we met.</p><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/flr_digger.gif" alt="Big digger falling down"/></p><p>Now that the days are getting colder, we cleaned the digger from the sand so that the kid can play with it inside. Due to the fact that we do not allow piles of sand in the children’s room he must content himself with reenactments of “the fall”.</p><p>Since we live next to a small train station were not only passenger trains but also a lot of cargo trains pass by, our son is really in love with trains and railway tracks. So we bought him a <strong>wooden train</strong>. There is a company that provides different sets with tracks and trains that all fit together. So we just told our family the brand name and now they can provide additional bridges, stations, and trains every now and then.</p><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/flr_train.jpg" alt="Trains and rails"/></p><p>In the first days Florentin did not manage to put the tracks toghether since the puzzlepiece linking was too complicated. Therefore he would always get angry and throw the wooden tracks through the room. At first we felt, that he was just too young for this kind of toy. But we continued to show him the right way to put the tracks toghether and he adopted himself very quickly. Now he is playing with his wodden train for hours. What a blessing! The piles of ironing get smaller and smaller since then.</p><p>Another great gift was the book “Good Night Gorilla”. We got it from a friend with a same aged daughter (I think like-minded people come up with the best gifts!). The story is about a zookeeper that says goodnight to all of the animals in the zoo. But the gorilla escapes and releases the other caged animals. They all secretly sneek behind the zookeeper and even follow him into his sleeping room.</p><p>The book barely contains text and you are able to tell the story with your own words. But it is still a story so you don’t need to be too creative when you are already tired ;)</p><p>We read the book together as a family almost every evening. The changing into the sleeping gown and toothbrushing goes pretty smooth since then. No more screaming and running away. The Gorilla really saved our evenings!</p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBrK58hi8KA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/08/18/brass-band-music/">Brass Band Music</a></h1><span class="post-date">18 Aug 2015 &ndash; 2 minutes to read</span><p>Sooner or later parents have to occupy themselves with the question: what toys do you give to your children. The reasons for this question are manifold:</p><ul><li>you want to retain to a certain concept of education</li><li>you want your child to mostly recieve natural materials like wood, stone and silk</li><li>you are constantly asked to provide ideas to relatives what present to bring for the next birth, christmas, easter, or as a small gift when visiting</li></ul><p>We mostly have to deal with the last case. We had to setup strict rules to prevent chaos from getting the best of us. Nonwithstanding the above mentioned educational concept nobody wants to meander through the apartment to sidestep piles of toys not even a child with an excavator could master.</p><p>In our family the rules for gifts are:</p><ol><li>No clothes for the kid</li><li>No presents that hold a battery compartment</li></ol><p>The first rule is easy to explain. We have been given children’s clothes from two families we are friends with and our son will have enough clothes to wear until his first day of school and beyond. What little still is missing we will buy ourselves.</p><p>The second rule is just as simple to explain but harder to understand. We - well actually it is just me - do not tolerate toys that make noises, play music, or emit honks and toots. These sounds freak me out. I swear after 15 minutes every bleeping absurdity will be thrown out of the window. I do not have the balls for this.</p><p>Meanwhile I tell this to every grandmother, aunt, grandgrandmother, and grant aunt. Every single guidebook for families advises parents to look after themselves and minimize stress and look for niches of recreation. Only when the parents are well, the family will be fine as well. And since I am 50 percent of the parents I am allowed to establish such strict rules.</p><p>So how do the rules work out? I can tell you: our child has not recieved a single gift with a battery to date. This is probably mostly due to the sanctions that will be imposed on violation of the rules. The person bringing the first battery powered toy will recieve a brass band as a thank-you note. It will be delivered on the front lawn early sunday morning.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiQJPVtrnhY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Do not get me wrong - we have nothing against Bavarian brass band music. But the established threatening posture works so far (our child is almost 2 years old).</p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/08/01/just-married/">Just Married</a></h1><span class="post-date">01 Aug 2015 &ndash;</span><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/marriage.jpg" alt="Just married"/></p><p>Hey guys, just in case you were wondering - its been very quiet here for a while.
