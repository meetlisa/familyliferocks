Therefore I need storage space on my bike since you never know which unwieldy toy is going to be the beloved one for my child at the moment. In the evenings he currently huddles up to a little wooden excavator…</p><p>Also always accompanying our excursions: diapers and baby wipes, spare clothes, corn waffles, and a drink. This does not sound like much but adds up to quiet a package. And all of this only to spend a couple of hours on the playground. But this is the way it is when you are a mother and the times of carrying a clutch bag on your shoulder are definetly over.</p><p>Since the first warmer days I prefer putting the little one on the bike since this enlarges our cruising radius tremendously and enables us to spend the afternoons in Augsburg’s minicipal forest “Siebentischwald”. Located in the forest is a playground that is already quite flooded with sunlight in spring.</p><p>But there is always one problem: how do I move all our stuff to the playground since having both the child and a piece of luggage safely stored and transported is not easily accomplished.</p><h2 id="safe-bicyling-with-a-child">Safe bicyling with a child</h2><p>I have voted for an infant seat mounted above the bicycle rack. This seemed to be the most practical solution. This way the seat is also slightly spring-suspended. I presume that this is somewhat healthier than dragging children around in a trailer. I always think that children are given a good shake at each curb the trailer must cross. But since all products for children have to undergo strict quality assurance tests and carry seals of approval this is probably only my imagination.</p><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/bicyle.jpg" alt="The bike"/></p><h2 id="the-bike">The bike</h2><p>My husband and me are surely especially focused on safety for different reasons that do not need to be discussed in detail. But it is by all means dead certain that we would have the infant seat fit by a professional. Not least because we lack the required tools. As a result I took the bicycle dealer’s advice concerning the subject of the supposed best bicycle parking rack. The one I have been using since the days of my early youth has failed me several times already. Unthinkable to have a child seated on the bike as well while using it.</p><p>A lot of parents have a sand resembling a fork. But I have been discouraged from using it for the fact that you are not supposed to expand or collapse it under load. Therefore you would have to lift up the bike including the seated child and luggage and support the weight with one arm to actually move the rack. Even the most motivated biker will not go through this for an extended stretch of time and therefore the fork will sooner or later need to be replaced due to the extra strain.</p><p>The recommended rack was mounted to the shaft of the rear wheel corresponding to the focal point where the child is seated. I had a change to test this setup for a couple of months and have to state that I am very pleased with the recommendation.</p><ol><li>child and bike are very heavy indeed</li><li>the bike has a solid stand since the rack has been attached to the ideal position</li></ol><h2 id="a-bicycle-with-a-child-is-not-automatically-a-cargo-carrying-bike">A bicycle with a child is not automatically a cargo-carrying bike</h2><p>We are now able to travel both safely and fast. But the question how to handle the baggage still remains. While riding a bicycle with a child seated behind you there is obviously cannot carry a backpack since it would be right in the child’s face which would be rather unpleasant. You also cannot use a shoulder bag since it woul deither have to be placed on the back as well or dangle irritatingly in front of your body. At the latest when climbing a hill this would become very annoying.</p><p>The idea of using saddle-bags was destroyed by the placement of the fenders of the child seat meant to protect the child’s feet. There must be a clever solution, but this is left as an experiment for a design student.</p><p>The bicycle dealer suggested a handlebar basket but even this solution has a constraint: you are not allowed to carry more than 5 kilogramm of cargo to prevent the risk of making the vehicle unstable and unbalanced. This would be a source of danger on its own.</p><p>I will have a bicycle basket mounted to my bike since it seems the only choice, although is might be unsuited for shopping. We will still have to use the stroller and use the appended basket for our purchases. A leaded stroller is hard to manouver as well, but you use it at a much lower speed.</p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/05/15/push-and-pull/">The kid is pushing things around</a></h1><span class="post-date">15 May 2015 &ndash; 2 minutes to read</span><blockquote><p>This is just a phase</p></blockquote><p>The mantra of all parents. We have reached the point of no return again, whenever we start repeating our mantra approximately 37 times a day. The reason: our child is rearranging our apartment.</p><p>It all began as we moved the bed in the children’s room to a different spot, just to see how it would work out. During the process a couple of things needed to be set aside, the carpet shifted and the whole room vacuumed while at it…he seemed to enjoy the action. Less than 3 hours later he began to rearrange the rest of our apartment.</p><p>Our apartement has a beautiful ancient boarded floor. A wooden floor is found in a lot of apartments around here since the houses in our neighborhood in Augsburg are really old. The modern apartments mostly have laminate floors. Trying to protect the parquet we attached felt pads from the local hardware store to every piece of furniture. But this makes it pretty easy to move around as well.</p><p>This does not sound so much like a problem? Well if you happen to stumble over your coffe table, need to go looking for your child underneath the carpet or discover the dustbin somewhere unexpected this can get on your nerves pretty quickly.</p><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/push-and-pull.jpg" alt="The kid pushing and pulling things around"/></p><p>This paying tag game has lasted for almost a month by now and I am beginning to wonder how long it will last in the end. You can hardly prohibit the movement of moving pieces and there is not enough space to hide away all the carpets, dustbins, and so on until this phase is over. And since most furniture has its place in the room for a reason I do not want to rearrange them anyway.</p><p>Currently our line of attack consists of being fulsome in one’s praise of the fact that something has been put back to its original position. While our boy moves things around we mostly try to ignore the action as we do not want it to become more thrilling than necessary. But does not work out all that well. It is admittedly funny enough to watch mum go looking for the dustbin approximately 8 times a day and putting it back in place.</p><p>By the way: we have not talked about the cruising radius yet. We are not referring to a circle of 2 meters. Our child is able to open doors (with the help of a child’s chair) and tresholds are no barriers at all. The waste bin was already been discovered blocking the apartment door, the bin for recycling materials was found in the office and the children’s chairs underneath the kitchen table.</p><p>Can someone hint at the deeper meaning behind this strange little habit? Florentin is now 19 months old and some resources point at this behavior as characteristic for children of his age. But no resource mentions why this behavior is developed and how long it will prevail. Time to clean up the mess. Excuse me.</p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/05/01/familyliferocks-on-tumblr/">We are on Tumbr</a></h1><span class="post-date">01 May 2015 &ndash;</span><p>We have created a tumblr blog where we will post all new entries published here on FamilyLifeRocks as well.

Or just pictures of delicately arranged food. But instead there are strict rules in todo lists parents have to restain themselves to, like “29 photos every parent MUST get of their baby” or “10 Manners every Child SHOULD know”. Further themes revolve around potty training, time out, and how to teach a toddler to pay more attention. Everything seems to be very rigid and somewhat negative.

But although we never wanted to become the typical dull parents we had not been out for what seemed like ages. The pregnancy lead to a demanding baby, nursing, and sleep deprivation and afterwards fighting difficulties with falling to sleep made our child not the best candidate for babysitting.</p><p>After sleep consultation this problem has been solved and we drove to Munich for a concert last night.</p><p>Wow! Driving with blasting speakers into civil twilight was already an adventure. I immediately was in a good mood flying over the half-empty autobahn and standing in line for admittance - how exciting! There were other grown-ups. Talk. Smoke. Kissing!</p><p>But moving through the crowd was the greatest experience while feeling absolutely free. Free as in “not constantly looking down at the ground in search for a toddler”. No supporting of a whining brat wriggling like an eel and noone carrying a diaper bag or looking for a baby-care room.</p><p>This all sounds nothing out of the ordinary, but for us it was awesome. Nothing more and nothing less. We meandered through the crowd and paused wherever we wanted. We danced, swayed, clapped and chanted. Freedom for 4 hours in a row can be lovely.</p><p>But of course we still have our favorite song ringing in our ears form last nights show:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nj_dBdhMNx4?list=PL43F8ECCB09C276FF" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Today we are all run down.
