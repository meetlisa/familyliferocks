But although we never wanted to become the typical dull parents we had not been out for what seemed like ages. The pregnancy lead to a demanding baby, nursing, and sleep deprivation and afterwards fighting difficulties with falling to sleep made our child not the best candidate for babysitting.</p><p>After sleep consultation this problem has been solved and we drove to Munich for a concert last night.</p><p>Wow! Driving with blasting speakers into civil twilight was already an adventure. I immediately was in a good mood flying over the half-empty autobahn and standing in line for admittance - how exciting! There were other grown-ups. Talk. Smoke. Kissing!</p><p>But moving through the crowd was the greatest experience while feeling absolutely free. Free as in "not constantly looking down at the ground in search for a toddler". No supporting of a whining brat wriggling like an eel and noone carrying a diaper bag or looking for a baby-care room.</p><p>This all sounds nothing out of the ordinary, but for us it was awesome. Nothing more and nothing less. We meandered through the crowd and paused wherever we wanted. We danced, swayed, clapped and chanted. Freedom for 4 hours in a row can be lovely.</p><p>But of course we still have our favorite song ringing in our ears form last nights show:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nj_dBdhMNx4?list=PL43F8ECCB09C276FF" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Today we are all run down. Missing sleep makes working hard and the ringing in our ears just has not subsided yet. But never mind. We are still young and have no regrets.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://chuckraganmusic.com/">chuckraganmusic.com</a></p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/parenting/2015/03/28/introducing-family-life-rocks/">Welcome to familylife.rocks</a></h1><span class="post-date">28 Mar 2015 &ndash;</span><p>We are Mama Lisa and Papa Christoph. Florentin is our son. He was born in August 2013. We are a family living in Germany. Is this something special? No. But for sure our life is different than family life in Canada, France or the Phillipines for example.</p><p><img src="//++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="familylife.rocks Logo"/></p><p>We want to show you how we organize and manage our daily life and how we deal with each other.</p><p>These are themes that concern every parent on the globe but we intent to take a special German perspective while looking at the laws and explaining how the state helps our little family and the problems we experience and face.</p><p>We will see what else comes to our minds. We enjoy blogging about parenting and family issues. The writing will by the way mostly be Lisa's duty while Christoph will take care of the programming and translations.</p><p>We are happy to have you with us on a short stretch of the way.</p><p>All the best from Bavaria, Germany</p><p>Lisa &amp; Christoph</p></div></div><div class="pagination"><span class="pagination-item older">Older</span> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/">Newer</a></div></div></div><label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label><script type="text/javascript">function downloadJSAtOnload(){var a=document.createElement("script");a.src="/++theme++flr.sitetheme/dist/js/flr.min.38228ec54d35.js",document.body.appendChild(a)}window.addEventListener?window.addEventListener("load",downloadJSAtOnload,!1):window.attachEvent?window.attachEvent("onload",downloadJSAtOnload):window.onload=downloadJSAtOnload;</script><div class="app-js-slot"><script type="text/javascript">WebFontConfig = {
