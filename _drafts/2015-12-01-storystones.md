Sometimes I am a very crafty mom. One of my latest projects are the story stones.

The idea is not my own. I found it in one of the german parenting blogs I follow. This gift idea for toddlers seemed perfect to me. Florentin is collecting stones wherever we go. So his interest in this material is an everyday topic in our family.

# Painting stones
At first you have to collect some flat stones. I liked that part of the process, because i had to wait anyway while Florentin is picking his own favorite stones on every corner. So why not spent the time well spent? I picked stones in the size of a walnut. But you should choose the size your kid can handle well.

Then i bought a set of acrylic paint because this color lasts best on stones. They sell acrylic colors in different quality. My experience: For the stones the cheapest quality is absolutely fine.

The next step is to wash the stones. Be careful, when you have a sink made of porcellain.

When the stones are dry you can start the painting. I choose the following pictures and symbols:
- numbers from one to nine
- sowflake and snowman
- boy and girl
- flower and Tree
- house
- raindrop and cloud
- rabbit and bird
- and some more

when I was done I sparayed the stones with fixative to make them last longer. Be careful with the smell - better do it outside.

# Story Stones as a gift
Florentin got his stones at his second birthday. Also his friend Helena got a handful. They were born in the same month. At first the were not very interested. Of course I was sad about that because of all the work. A few days later I cought Florentin throwing his stones around so i put them away. A few weeks later he asked for them and played very careful with the stones. Since then he puts them in and out of the little sack and puts them in lines.

I feel that the motives don't really matter - as long as they are colorful.
