##Autumn Activities with a two year old boy
We live in a city. There are less chances to see the season changes than tere are when you live on a small village. So we try to show Florentin the difference between the seasons anyway. 
So now there it is: Florentins second autumn. This time last year he just learned how to walk alone. everytime he could, he run away from us to walk through the dry autumn foliage. He liked the rustling so much. It was a joy to watch him until.... he stepped in dog poop for the first time.
Luckily i had a plastic bag with me. So I put the shoes in it. To prevent his feet from the cold i put my own gloves onto his feet. That looked weird but it was ok. After this first time it happend again for like four times. Can you imagine the gread joy of scratching dog poop from a kids shoe...

This year, we do focus more on indoor activities.
