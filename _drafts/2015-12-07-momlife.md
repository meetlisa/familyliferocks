During research for this blog I tried to observe different social media channels and platforms for entries on the subject of **momlife**. Here are some of my insights.

##momlife on Pinterest  

Momlife on Pinterest is full of words of advice. Instead of looking at this Social Network you can just buy one of this life saving guidebooks. The #momlife hashtag consist of prayers (Father, fill me with the strength to support, guide and walk my children through the stage they're growing through today.), advcices (How To Keep Baby Occupied All Day) and - of course - tips for beauty and household (20 Life-Changing Hacks for Doing Your Nails).

Feminism? Never heard about. Compatibility of family and career? Not my business. Career Tips für moms? Your kids are your career! Hello Pinterest, wake up. It's 2015!

##momlife on Twitter  

Momlife on twitter is mostly fun and sarcasm. I enjoy looking through this hashtag every day. The best Tweets will be retweeted on our [FamilyLife.Rocks Account](https://twitter.com/familyrocksblog). It is so nice to see that other moms struggle too. For me it feels strenghtening and empowering to see momlife besides of perfect world commercials were everyone wears white clean clothes and the air is full with the smell of applepie...

Amongst some of my favorite examples is this tweet by **MommaPebz**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playdoh is the epitome of love/hate. Hate the mess, love the HOURS of peaceful, content kids. [#momlife](https://twitter.com/hashtag/momlife?src=hash)</p>-- ››Heidi‹‹ (@MommaPebz) [December 3, 2015](https://twitter.com/MommaPebz/status/672498147390717952)</blockquote>

Twitter will be a standard when looking for inspiration.

##Momlife on Facebook

Momlife on Facebook is nearly as funny as momlife on twitter. The big difference is that there are a lot more entries that contains pictures of the kids. Since we are a no-pictures-of-the-kid's-face-on-the-internet-family we don't support that.

##Momlife on Tumblr

I think the spectrum of momlife posts is biggest on tumblr. Everyday I find Post that praise the inventor of alcohol, celebrates the afterbabybody and the afterbabyworkout or show everyday scenes with the kids.

In my perception, the pro breastfeeding movement is strongest on tumblr. You find a lot of pictures that show the normalcy of nursing without being pornography or too intimate. This is so great! And it s sad at the same time. Why do you need a movement for something that is so natural???
