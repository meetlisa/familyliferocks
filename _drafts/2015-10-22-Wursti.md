##Baby Head Support Pillow

Nine is not much when it's about money, cupcakes or panties. But when it comea to Babyies, nine is al lot. Our friends. neighbours and collegues all toghether got nine babies this year. They alle are so close to us, that we wanted to give them a gift for the new arrival.
As a constant reader of our blog you may have realised that I have some issue with kids clothes - we just have too much. Particulary the newborn sizes are popular gifts - maybe it is because they are cute as hell and shopping cute things is big fun.
But i am not that i-give-you-the-27th-onesie-for-your-baby-person. I really like useful and individual gifts. So I invented the "Wursti".
