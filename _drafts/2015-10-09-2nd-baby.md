##Planning a second baby

I checked the most popular search terms on google around the topic of a second pregnancy. Besides Kim Kardashian, most people look for 
- second baby
- another baby
- second pregnancy
It seems that no one is interested in havin a second kid or another offspring. Everyone is only looking fp the baby related topics. But (spoiler alert) also the second child will grow, run around, bring home strange friends and ask for tuition fee.

I personally do not plan for another sweet bundle to lay around and ask for boobie time. I plan for talks with my kids, for education and for a happy clan with a lot of grandchildren. statistically spoken you will have more grandchildren when you have more kids. Wich is nice when you sit in a retrirement home and the othergrumpy people are jealous about your visitors.

#Is the second pregnancy/delivery easier?

As the person with the uterus i think I have at least 51 percent power of decision when it comes to the "how many kids do we want" talk. Of cours I do think about my body. It is nice to learn that for most oft the woman the second delivery is much easier than the first one. But it scares me that I know at least 3 people in person that suffered with nausea so much more in their second pregnancy than in the first one. Imagine to take care of Kid number one while you hang over the toilet seat vomiting... How did the woman in the past milion years managed this situation while their men haunted the mammoths???
