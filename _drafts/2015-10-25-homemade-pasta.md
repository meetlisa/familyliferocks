#Pasta Recipe - fun food for toddlers

For me it's important that my children learn how much work goes into the various products of daily life. So I love to show Florentin how theings wer built, made and cooked. Last week we made homemade pasta.

Christoph and I have some experience with the pasta thing, because we made it several times three years ago, when we got the pasta machine a a gift from our friend. But when I got pregnant I became lazy and I didnÂ´t feel like standin for too long. So we put the pasta machine away.

Now we have a toddler who says that his fovourite food is "pasta with meat" which is funny because we mostly eat vegetarian food since Christoph stopped eating meat like 20 years ago. But the pasta part of his wish we can fulfill with great joy.

##Ingredients for homemade pasta

- 1 cup durum wheat semolina
- 2 cups flour (or pasta flour)
- 2-3 eggs
- a handful of salt
- water (upon need)

##Preparation home made pasta

Mix all the ingredients together by hand knead and work well. Let the dough rest for some well packaged. We leave it for about an hour or at least half an hour.

Now you need to roll out the dough thinly. We have a hand operated pasta machine for that. But you can also use a rolling pin and some brawn. When the dough is thin enough jou can cut it in stripes or use a 'pasta bike' to make a somehow classical pasta form.

##Pasta family fun

We told our kid that "we make pasta on saturday". So he asked us permanently when saturday is and talked about the pasta machine. You can imagine how exited he was when I finally installed the machine in the kitchen.
