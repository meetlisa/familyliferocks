On Christmas time every family tries to feel peaceful, happy and cosy. We do too. But there is a christmas-monster we really fear for every year: The diaper of dread.

Last year we ended with an open window while the changing process (remember: December in Germany is cold!), with one of the big picture books as a frond (Wedel) and with me having an asthma attack. We never experienced such a bad pop smell before.

# What happened?
Just one word: smoked salmon.

It's very nice that my mother in law brings us a big piece of salmon every year around Christmas as a gift. We celebrate the eating and create different food e.g. with horse radish or with cram and pasta. This is a tradition Christoph and I settled in the last 10 years.

One of the things you have to do as a parent is sharing every piece of food with your kid. So, of course we gave Florentin an piece of salmon - just to try if he likes it. Of course he liked it. Just like Olives, Gorgonzola Cheese and other spicy things we thought, kids hate.

Unsuspecting the bad surprise we would find in his diaper in the next morning, we gave Florentin more smoked salmon and more...

This year we think about how to keep the salmon as a secret from him. But maybe we are stronger than last year and can stand the changing process with more stateliness...?
