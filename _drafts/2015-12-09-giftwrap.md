title: make your own gift wrap for christmas
categories: DIY
---

When you have acess to big sheets of paper you can easily create your own gift wrap that will the grandma's go crazy. Here is how:
1. Fix the Paper on the table or the floor (I use masking tape because you can easily remove)
2. Hand pencils to your kids (Since Florentin is only two years old we hand him big wax crayons)
3. Wait
4. Remove the masking tape
5. Wrap gifts

Since I am a person that makes long term plans, I am collecting Florentins paintings since we started to paint with him. So I have a nice stash of possible gift wrap that I use for christmas and the birthday presents of the family.
