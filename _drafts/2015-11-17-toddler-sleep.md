#Make your toddler sleep

In the age of 6 months a kid can learn to fall asleep alsone (without breastfeeding, carrying or snuggling). This ist what we learned when our son was 18 month old when we came to the sleep advice for children. 

##Toddler sleeping Problems

Not the sleep itself, but the process of falling asleep was our kids problem. He just couldn't calm down. Instead of laying around cute and cosy he was jumping, giggling and did gymnastics. Every evening one of us had to lay with him fpr hours to help him calm down. In the last few weeks before we asked for help, the process normally last fpr 2 1/2 hours!

We never knew, when our "parent closing time" would be and the time toghether as a couple was alsways less. As soon as the child at night for the first time was awake , one of us had to put him to bed .

Nap was actually only place in the stroller. Well, I saw this as my sporty balance to walk Lunch 1.5 hours by him. But that was no long-term solution. Especially since I had to pay close attention to that also yes no excavators or cranes were seen on our way , for he would immediately have been wide awake again: "craaaaane"

## The aid in sleep advice

I must say, in Augsburg, the network of support for families is very closely. The reason is that we had a fantastic time for a long time social speakers , but also that all the churches are very active in Augsburg (we are the city of the religios Peace - Augsburg Confession). I myself ended up with our toddler sleeping problems in a family center and SOS Children's Villages got there a free consultation appointment.

The conversation with the child psychologist and family therapist was very tiring. I was there alone and had to tell exactly how my own childhood was like the birth of my son has gone and how family life works for us like that. These are violent themes, if they should be compressed argued before a stranger.

The diagnosis of the therapist was: Our child has taken control . It determines exactly who, when to stand next to his bed and how long . This is exhausting for the child (because it actually wants his child and hopes that parents provide direction ) and for the parents exhausting (because it is unpleasant to lose control).

So it should be the goal , back to back and clarify who is in this situation ( bed , falling asleep ) of the boss's family relationships straight.

##The path to better family sleep

We started with the familiarization of the evening, when the Oscars were televised. The child had just become healthy again and correspondingly fit and I thought to myself , if the Einschlafdrama now drags on for hours , I can in between See me at least a couple of nice clothes .

So I took the usual bedtime , but was careful to assume a prone position next to my son in any way. He should not get the idea that I do it comfortably to me :
1. Brushing and undressing in bathroom
2. Pajamas put in the nursery
3. Close the blinds toghether, open window for ventilation
1. Lying down , cuddly wrap and tell something of the day
2. Make windows , put next to it and still sing something or humming
3. Goodnight kiss to go out

Said and done. As our child was not in the crib at that time, he can just walk around. So he's got up after a brief surprise and has been looking for me. I laid him back and walked out. This game lasted 50 minutes. Then all was quiet. The Oscars had not even begun.

On the second day I had success after 10 minutes, the third after 5. One can imagine how we were amazed !

It is important to me that my tactics will not be applied here as a model for other children, because there are so many details that you have to pay atention for. In the worst case, the child will suffer in the transition under any circumstances or be traumatized. Should you have a similar problem, then you look it out in your city for a consultancy to. There are therapists who you have to pay yourself, but also many offers of the city or of free and church organizations. This should take necessarily complete.

For a long time our life as a familie has since greatly improved. Florentin knew as he can fall asleep alone, but gets the well at night quite well out. At first There are about a week 1 or 2 nights, in which he was completely asleep (or does not cry). But then most of the nights were very relaxing for me and Christoph.

##Back to the start

But then the second Birthday came. Hindsight it feels that all the problems started again on the exact day when our son turned two. All of a sudden we were confronted with dramatic temper tantrum with a lot of crying and screaming and lashing around. Also the sleeping drama started again. The difference: Now heÂ´s 24 months old, he knows how to undress. So when we left the room he started to turn off his pyjama and diaper and peed on his pillow. The mountains of lundry grew to record highs... So the sleeping process became stressful again. We sat very calmly next to his door, listening about every little sound and rush in, as soon as we hear the plopping of the pyjama buttons.

Again, we sat there for hours. Especially the naps became horrible, because he finally fell asleep when the other kids wake up wich means that all of a sudden all our playdates were cancelled.
