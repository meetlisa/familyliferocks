---

Last month our son turned two, but the party felt like a premiere anyway, since we hardly celebrated his 1st birthday. Yes, he recieved some gifts, but no big party was held. We felt that he was still too young for the big family-meetup not least because he was quite afraid of unknown sounds and noises at the time. And when people meet, there are a lot of noises.

This year we invited the grandparents, aunts and uncles and two other little kids the same age. The biggest surprise was the Punch-and-Judy show my mother planned for the kids. We, the grown ups, enjoyed the play. But the kids didn't really get it. To be honest: that was the biggest fun!

We also had a lot of cake, candles, and food. We were happy about the good wheather so that most of the guest could be seated in the garden.

## Second birthday gifts for little boys

Florentin got a lot of great stuff. Let me tell you about some of the best ones. Spoiler: None of them **contain a battery compartement**.

The biggest gift is the big **digger**. And with "big" I mean big enough to sit on it. With two levers you can dig a handful of sand or little stones. What can i say: Florentin went nuts! My sister, she was the giving person, enjoyed the exitement of the little boy. Since the packaging contained the digger in dismantled parts he could hardly wait until the digger was completely put toghether. The next few days he wanted to spent every second in the garden to dig some sand and dry grass around.

After a couple of days he moved the digger too close to the concrete steps at the end of the garden and they both, Florentin and the digger, fell down over the edge. Our son was quite proud of his big bump and showed the band aid to everybody.

Now that the days are getting colder, we cleaned the digger from the sand so that the kid can play with it inside. Due to the fact that we do not allow piles of sand in the children's room he must content himself with reenactments of "the fall".
