#Florentins 2nd Birthday: A Band aid and a Gorilla

Last month our son already turned two. But the party felt like a premiere anyway. The reason is, that we hardly celebrated his 1st birthday. Yes, he got some gifts, but no big Party. We felt that he was tool small for the crowded family-meetup nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil he was afraid of unknows sounds and noises. And when people meet, there are a lot of noises.

This year we invited the grandparents, aunts and uncles and two other little kids the same age. The biggest surprise was the Punch-and-Judy show my mother planned for the kids. We, the grown ups, really enjoyed the play. But the kids didn't get anything. To be onest: that was the biggest fun!

Besides that we had a lot of cake, candles an food. We were happy about the good wheather so that most of the guest stayed in the garden.

##2nd birthday gifts for little boys

Florentin got a lot of great stuff. I will tell you about some of the best gifts. Spoiler: None of them **contains a battery compartement (Link zum Brass Band)**.

The biggest gift ist the big **digger**. And with "big" I mean that you can sit on it. With two levers you can dig a handful of sand or little stones. What should I say: Florentin went nuts! My sister, she was the giving person, enjoyed the exitement of the little boy. He could hardly wait until the digger was completely put toghether. The next few days he wanted to spent every second in the garden to dig some sand and dry grass around.

After a week or two he drove the digger too close to the concrete steps at the end of the garden. Both, Florentin and the digger, felt down. I must say that our son was very proud of his big bump and showed the band aid to everyone we met.

Now, that the days are colder, we cleaned the digger from the sand so thad the kid can play inside. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass im Kinderzimmer kein Sand zu finden ist, spielt Florentin eben "falling down".

Since we live next to a small train station were not only passenger trains stop bt also a lot of cargo trains, our son is really loving trains an tracks. So we bought him a **wooden train**. There is a company that provides different sets with tracks and trains that all fit together. So we just taugth the family the brand name. Now they can add some rail bridges an stations and trains now and then. 

In the first days Florentin didn't get the right way to put the tracks toghether. The puzzle-like linkor was too complicated. So he got angry and threw the tracks through the room. At first we felt, that he was just too little for that kind of toy. But we continued to show him the right way to put the tracks toghether and he leraned very quickly. Now he ist playin with the train for hours. What a blessing! Since then the hills of ironing get a smaller and smaller.

Another great gift was the book "Good Night Gorilla". We got it from a friend with a same aged daughter (I think theese people make the best gifts!). The story is about a zookeeper that says goodnight to all oft the animals. But the Gorilla escapes and releases the other caged. They all secretly walk behind the zookeeper until his sleeping room.

The book barely contains text. So you can tell the story by your own words. But it is still a story so you don't need to be too creative when you're tired ;)

We read the book toghether as a family every evening. Since then the changing and toothbrushing goes very well. No more screaming and running away. The Gorilla really saved our evenings!
