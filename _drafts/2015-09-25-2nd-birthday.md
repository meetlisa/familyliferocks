#Florentins 2nd Birthday

Last month our son turned two. But the Party felt like a premiere anyway. The reason is, that we hardly celebrated his 1st birthday. Yes, he got some gifts, but no big Party. We felt that he was tool small for the big family-meetup nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil he was afraid of unknows sounds and noises. And when people meet, there are a lot of noises.

This year we invited the grandparents, aunts and uncles and two other little kids the same age. The biggest surprise was the Punch-and-Judy show my mother planned for the kids. We, the grown ups, enjoyed the play. But the kids didn'tget anything. To be onest: that was the biggest fun!

Besides that we had a lot of cake, candles an food. We were happy about the good wheather so that most of the guest stayed in the garden.

##2nd birthday gifts for little boys

Florentin got a lot of great stuff. I will tell you about some of the best gifts. Spoiler: None of them **contains a battery compartement**.

The biggest gift ist the big **digger**. And with "big" I mean that you can sit on it. With two levers you can dig a handful of sand or little stones. What should i say: Florentin went nuts! My sister, she was the giving person, enjoyed the exitement of the little boy. He could hardly wait until the digger was completely put toghether. The next few days he wanted to spent every second in the garden to dig some sand and dry grass around.

Then he drove the digger too close to the concrete steps at the end of the garden. both, Florentin and the digger, felt down. I must say that our son was very proud of his big bump and showed the band aid to everybody.

Now, that the days are colder, we cleaned the digger from the sand so thad the kid can play inside. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass im Kinderzimmer kein Sand zu finden ist, spielt Florentin eben "falling down".
