Today we want to tell you how we celebrate the our weeks of advent in Germany. It may sound that Christoph and I are professionals with Christmas stuff, but in fact we as a family celebrate the holidays for the first time. The reason is, that Florentin was just too little last year.

Of course, we have years of experience following the traditions of our families. But this year we have the chance to settle our own. So we are kind of exited because everyone knows, how important the christmas childhood memories are. Now we create the ones for our son...

##Advent wreath

Luckily my mom gave us everything we need to twine the advent wreath. You need a straw wreath, wire, 4 candle holders, some decoration (pinecones) and - of course some evergreen.

I was hoping that Florentin would "help" me with the twining, but he developed a fever and just sat there and watched me. But I was fine with that because everything is faster, when your kid is just looking instead of helping ;)

The advent wreath will be lighted on Sundays after the nap, when wee sit together for coffee break and eat some cookies and Christmas Stollen (a typical Saxon christmas bisquit).

##Advent Calendar

When Christoph and I were kids (back in the 70s and 80s) an Advent Calendar was a small gift. Some were filled with Chocolate, but most of them hold only very small gifts in each box or just pictures.

In the last years we heard from our friends with kids how big the Calendars became since then. Some contain a LEGO gift or an animal each day. On Christmas Eve you have a complete Farm or the Star Wars Death Star.

We felt that this is too big as a every day gift. So luckily I found a pretty normal Advent Calendar with pictures. Our Plan is to open the window each day together as a reward for Florentin when he brushed his teeth.

##Stars everywhere

"Star" wars one of the first words Florentin learned to say when he was a little child. So we looked for stars everywhere in his books, on the kids clothes and on the streets (e.g. on advertisements). When we installed a lightening star in his room, he went nuts.

So yesterday we pulled out the box with the Christmas Decoration and Florentin was happy to see the "star box" again. This weekend we cleaned and decorated our apartment. Here are the results:

##Christmas Tree

This year we install our first own Christmas Tree. But this deserves an own article...
