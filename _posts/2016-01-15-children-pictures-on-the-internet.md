This blog is still young and only contains a few articles. But you might already have noticed that we do not post any pictures of our child. This is not a coincident but a well considered move. We actively decided to not publish any fotos of our son.


## Our child is cute

Well of course our little boy is the cutest and most handsome child on the planet. No doubt about it. We are so sure of this fact that we do not need the reassurance and applause of the internet for our son. We know the good looks of our son and so do our family and friends. This is enough.

If we would make pictures of our son publicly available on the internet than everyone could download, steal, or use them. We would not have any influence on whatever happened to these pictures. Therefore we do not post any pictures in the first place.

## Content matters

We want to share some details and stories of our lives but mostly focus on our experiences and not so much on our faces. If you do find our stories boring just move on. Those still here: happy reading.

We sure try to spice up our postings with pictures since reading would indeed be a bit boring. We try to think about what pictures we use. We are convinced that our articles still serve their duty without us posting the face of our son.

## A great debate in Germany

Currently a hot discussion is taking place amongst German parenting bloggers wether posting pictured of your children on the internet. Lisa has attended a panel discussion taking place on one of the biggest German business festivals the re:publica in Berlin that concluded that we are part of the minority with our approach.

The parents uploading pictures usually have their arguments.

- Our children will suspect that we think they are ugly when they notice that all their classmates have cute pictures of themselves on the internet a couple of years from now

- My articles on the intimate daily routines of our family offer so many insights that I can publish family pictures as well since it makes no difference anymore

- My children get filmed and recorded in public like e.g in shops and on the streets anyway

In our opinion these arguments are mostly nonsense. The underlying reasons to post these pictures is mostly the fact that they promise more clicks. More clicks equals more money in most cases.

We admit that the mother blogging about her daily routines with a disabled child has a valid reason: "I show pictures of my child on the internet because I want to raise awareness to the theme of living with disabilities. I believe people should be able to see, that we live a normal life. Disabled persons have been hidden away from the public for too long already."

## The career of our offspring

We have ssen it all: crying children, sick children, mothers describing the consistency of their offsprings morning shit. The internet never forgets - 15, 20, 42 years from now it will still be possible to find these contents. Awkward scenes on weddings, meetings, or during political campaigns are inevitable.

But we can think of another valid reason not to show the face of our son on the internet: face detection. As soon as a service like Facebook or Google has your photos they are able to recognize you everywhere. This might sound a little strange or even farfetched but these are the facts: we would like to enable Florentin to shape his future the way he prefers. Therefore he should be able to decide for himself should he ever consider a career as resistance fighter and strive for independence if he pleases without his face already stored in every database.

Paraphrasing the argument: we take special care that he does not cut his eyes out by accident with a fork and spoil his spotless career as a pilot as well.
