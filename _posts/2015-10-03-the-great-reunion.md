25 years ago the two parts of Germany became one again. And as every year on the 3rd of October, the day of the German reunification, we see the reruns of the events and the fall of the Berlin Wall on TV.

Since each of us was born on a different side of the wall we somehow had a out own special celebration of the events that took place 25 years ago today by getting married in the anniversary year.
