Today we want to tell you about how we celebrate the four weeks of Advent in Germany. Though Christoph and I might appear to be rather seasoned with Christmas stuff this holiday season will in fact be the first time for us as a family to celebrate the holidays. Mostly because Florentin was still too young last year.

We of course look back on years of experience with our family's traditions, but this time we have the chance to establish our own. Therefore we are somewhat exited since everyone knows the important role that Christmas plays when it comes to childhood memories. Now we have the chance to create these pleasant memories for our son...

Luckily my mom gave us everything we needed to twine the advent wreath. You need a straw wreath, wire, 4 candle holders, some decoration (pinecones) and of course some evergreen.

I was hoping that Florentin would "help" me with the twining, but he developed a fever and just sat there and watched. But I was fine with that because every process is significantly faster when your kids are just standing by instead of giving a helping hand ;)

The advent wreath will be lighted on Sundays after the nap, when we sit together for a coffee break and eat some cookies and Christmas stollen (a typical sweet from Saxony during Christmas season).

# Advent Calendar

Back in the days when Christoph and I were kids (back in the 70s and 80s) an Advent calendar was a small present to help pass the time until Christmas Eve. Some were simply filled with chocolate but most held only tiny presents or pictures behind each door.

In recent years we often heard from friends with children how big the calendars have become since then. Some contain a LEGO gift or an animal each day and on Christmas Eve you will have a complete farm or the Star Wars Death Star.

We felt that this is too big as an every day gift. So luckily I found a pretty Advent calendar with pictures behind each door. We plan to open the door each day together as a reward for Florentin brushing his teeth.

# Stars everywhere

"Star" was one of the first words Florentin learned to say when he was a little child. So we naturally looked for stars everywhere in his books, on his clothes and out on the streets (e.g. on advertisements). I still remember how excited he got when we installed a glowing star in his room.

Yesterday we pulled out the box with the Christmas decoration and Florentin was very happy to see the box containing the star again. Last weekend we cleaned the house and decorated our apartment. Here are the results:

# Christmas Tree
This year we will install our first Christmas tree. But this alone deserves an extra article anyway...
