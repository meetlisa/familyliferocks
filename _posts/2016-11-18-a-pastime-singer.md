There was a time when my only focus was writing and performing music. I
seriously considered music as a profession. While not being talented or assertive enough
to really push my luck I still spent several hours a day writing songs and
practicing. But then life got in the way and lead me along to the place where I am now -
caring for a family and rarely finding the time to pick up a guitar and only climbing
on the stage on special occasions during open microphone events.

But since last year marked the 25th anniversary of performing my songs in front
of an audience I received a very special Christmas present: a video recording session.

"Neon" is one of these recordings. I hope you enjoy the old me fumbling for the
microphone to sing a homemade tune.
