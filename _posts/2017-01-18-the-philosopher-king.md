Putting the boy to bed:

*"Daddy, daaaaaaady"*<br>
**[moves from the kitchen to the bedroom door, glances around the corner]**<br>
"Yes, son?"<br>
*"Can we talk?"*<br>
"Yes..."<br>
*"Not like this"*<br>
"Pardon?"<br>
*"Closer, you have to be closer"*<br>
"..ok, like so?" **[moves to the bedside]**<br>
*"...can you move a little closer?"*<br>
"..ok, like so?" **[kneels down by the bed]**<br>
*"...can you move a little closer?"*<br>
"Yes, like so...?"**[leans into the bed]**<br>
*"Not this closer, another closer. Can you move a little closer?!"*<br>
"I see..." **[rests his head on the edge of the bed]**<br>
*"..."* **[moves around the bed for the best part of a century]**<br>
"Now this is close enough I would imagine..."<br>
*"Ok, now talk"*<br>
"What do you want to talk about?"<br>
*"..."* **[a silence as deep as the deep blue sea]**<br>
"What do you want to talk about?"<br>
*"You tell me...yes"*<br>
"Oh, well, you wanted to talk to me, son..."<br>
*"You say, you say"* **[the biggest and brightest eyes you will ever see]**<br>
"Ok, ok, so...how was your day?"<br>
*"..."* **[a galaxy collapses, dies, and is reborn]**<br>
"...ahm, did you have a nice day at the kindergarten?"<br>
*"..."*<br>
"Well, what did you do today?"<br>
*"...everything"*
