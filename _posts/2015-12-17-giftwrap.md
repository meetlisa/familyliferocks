When you have access to big sheets of paper you can easily create your own gift wrap with included quarantee to make the grandmas go crazy.

This is how you can produce your own:

1. Fix the Paper on the table or the floor (I use masking tape because you can easily remove it again)
2. Hand pencils to your kids (Since Florentin is only two years old we hand him big wax crayons)
3. Wait
4. Remove the masking tape
5. Wrap gifts

Since I am a person that tends to think in long term plans, I have been collecting Florentin's paintings since we seriously started to paint with him. Therefore I now have a nice stack of possible gift wraps that I can use for Christmas and birthday presents of the family.
